/**
 * what is the use of constructor
 *      Constructor is a function whci has name as 'constructor'
 *      Js executes the constructor in order to creates the object of the class.
 *      In other words, constructor has to run completely, in order to crete an object of the class.
 * 
 * why do we need object of a class
 *      with help of an object, we can access the non-static functions and variables of that class.
 * 
 * what is a class
 *      Class is a template which represent real-life entity.
 *      a class representing House (in this call, we will have variables (to store info about a house) and functions (to actions in a house)
 *      a class representing Student (in this call, we will have variables (to store info about a student) and functions (to actions by a student)
 * 
 * what is an object of a class
 *      object is an instance of a class
 *      an object of student-class, represent first student.
 *      second object of student-class, represent second student.
 * 
 *      an object of a house-class, this object represent a particular house.
 * 
 * how to decide whether variable to be static or not in a class?
 *      if a variable to be shared between all objects, we make it static otherwise non-static.
 * 
 * how to decide whether function to be static or not in a class?
 *      if a functions is to class we make it static otherwise non-static
 * 
 * how many constructors we can have in a class?
 *      one (js doesn't allow more than one constructor in a class)
 * 
 * can we have input-parameters in a constructor?
 *      yes
 * 
 * what is a default constructor?
 *      when we don't constructor in a class; so js creates a default constructor and executes it in order to create an object of class
 * 
 * what is this-operator?
 *      this-operator in a class represents the current object using which we are accessing the functions/variables.

/**
 * OOP Concept (OOP -> Object Oriented Programming)
 * 
 * 1. Encapsulation
 *      Wrapping up cpde in a single unit (i.e. Class)
 *      To implement Encapsulation concept, we create Class and write code in it.
 * 
 * 2. Abstraction
 *      Hiding unnecessary information from user
 *      To implement Abstraction concept, we create functions.
 *      
 * 3. Inheritance
 *      -> To implement Inheritance, we need to have a parent-child relationship between two classes.
 *      -> we use "extends" keyword with childClass, in order to create parent-child relation with anotherClass.
 *      -> childClass gets access to parentClass/grandParentClass variable and functions (except private variable/functions)
 *      -> a class can extend ONLY one class (why? - Diamond Problem)
 * 
 * 4. Polymorphism
 *
